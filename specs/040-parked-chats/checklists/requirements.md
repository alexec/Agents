- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria

## Notes

- The three scope questions (where Parked sits, whether it ever wakes by itself, parking a working chat) were answered by Alex on 2026-09-24 and are recorded under Clarifications.
- "The daemon" in FR-012 names the product's own always-on part, as earlier specs do, not a technology.
- The interaction with 039's Blocked group is an assumption to confirm when both are planned.
